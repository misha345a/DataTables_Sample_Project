# DataTables Sample Project

This sample project demonstrates the basic structure required to connect an HTML tableâ€™s data feed to a JS server-side script. 

The <a href="https://datatables.net/">jQuery DataTables</a> plug-in is used to enhance the table and populate its contents with fake data from an <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">online REST API</a>.  As a result, the HTML table becomes responsive, interactive, and linked to the server.
